    <h1>Frozen & Tarzan</h1>
    
    <p>&#9654; Anna, Elsa and Tarzan are siblings. When Annas and Elsas parents traveled by ship to another country, that we can see in the beginning of the Frozen movie, the ship crashed and sank, Annas and Elsas mom and dad washed up on a deserted island and had a baby there. And that is a confirmed theory by the Frozen producer.
</p>
        
    <h1>Little Mermaid</h1>
    
    <p>&#9654; Little mermaid in the movie explores a sunken ship. Fans believe that that ship is actually the ship that sank with Elsas and Annas parents. To support the theory - the Frozen kingdom is located in Norway and Little mermaid is based in Denmark, so that makes sense, that the ship crashed somewhere near the mermaids land, aka Denmark.</p>
        
           <h1>Aladdin</h1>
            <p>&#9654; 
Movie “Aladdin” is set in a far far future. When Aladdin finds the Genie lamp, and releases the Genie,Genie says that he has been trapped in the lamp for 10 000 years. But the thing is- Genie refers to such classics as Therminator, Las Vegas casinos and much more modern movies and references, that made fans think that he actually has experienced it all and movie “Aladdin” is in the far future where we get flying carpets. ;D
</p>        
       
        <h1>Cars</h1>
        <p>&#9654;Have you ever thought why in the movie “Cars” all cars have different accents? The producer has of the movie have said that the cars absorbed the accent of their previous owners. And then got rid of all humans, that means that the movie is set in the far future, where cars took over the world. </p>
	
       
			 <h1>Tarzan</h1>
  <p>&#9654;Jane from movie “Tarzan” is a descendent from Bell and the Beast. To support the theory - in the jungle a monkey plays drums on the cutlery that looks awfully similar to the singing and talking cups and pods from Beauty and the Beast. And when Jane traveled, she took the cutlery with her.</p>
       </div>

			<h1>Snow White</h1>	
            <p>&#9654; The Evil Queen from Snow White and the seven dwarfs actually exist not only in the Snow white universe but also in the Tangled universe. The reason behind this theory is that in both movies there is an evil old witch that hunts young and beautiful girls to suck out the beauty out of them.
                Fans believe that the magic that kept her beauty and youthfulness kept her alive and she moved on to her next pray - Rapunzel, where the witch had a name - Mother Gothel. And also two characters look very similar.</p>
       
			<h1>Brave</h1>	
            <p>&#9654; According to Jon Negroni, fourteen Pixar movies all exist in the same universe. Toy Story, A Bug’s Life, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille, Wall-E, Up, and Brave and are all included in this theory. The timeline begins with Brave, which is set in the dark ages and it ends with Monsters Inc, which takes place around the year 4500. The films are seeking to illustrate the connection between humans, animals, and the environment.</p>
        
			<h1>Tangled</h1>	
            <p>&#9654; Rapunzel is attending the royal wedding of Anna and Kristoff. Fans believe that the three girls are actually cousins.</p>

			<h1>Insideout</h1>	
            <p>&#9654; In case you didn’t notice, Bing Bong is a character who was left out of the marketing for the film leading up to its release. The reason for this is because Pete Docter, the director of Inside Out, wanted Bing Bong and his death to be a total surprise. Many people were shocked and heartbroken when they found out that Bing Bong sacrificed himself in order to save Joy. What if he is not dead? What if he is actually a monster from Monsters, Inc that Riley saw as a little girl and assumed was imaginary? He is known for making Riley laugh, which is exactly what monsters do to get power.</p>
       
		
	     
			<h1>Toy Story</h1>	
            <p>&#9654; When Jessie was first introduced in Toy Story 2, fans knew her as the cowgirl with a fear of getting abandoned. Her old owner, Emily, has neglected her for years and then tossed her into a donation bin. It takes a long time, but Jessie learns how to trust again and she is very happy to become Andy’s new toy. The problem with this emotional and heartbreaking story is that Jessie never gets any real closure. One very popular fan theory claims that Andy’s mom is actually Emily, all grown up. </p>

			<h1>Frozen</h1>	
            <p>&#9654; In a bizarre new theory from Screen Rant, Disney fans are claiming that the studio chose to name its 2013 smash-hit movie “Frozen” to distract people from the popular urban legend that Walt Disney was cryogenically frozen with hopes of reanimation.However, it is widely accepted that Mickey Mouse’s creator was cremated.
                That didn’t stop the rumors from growing and persisting over the years. Screen Rant states that before 2013’s “Frozen” came out, Google searches of “Disney frozen” yielded results surrounding Walt’s body.</p>
     
	
	    
			<h1>Up</h1>	
            <p>&#9654; Up tugged at our heartstrings more than most thanks to its opening scene titled "Married Life". After watching Ellie and Carl’s life together, it was easier to see why Mr Fredrickson had become a grumpy loner in his later years. This was all turned around by the arrival of the joyous Russell...or was it?There is an emotional theory that Carl is dead all along and his trip to Paradise Falls is his move into the afterlife. Going with this, Russell is an angel trying to earn his wings (Wilderness Explorer badge). Elsewhere, Charles Muntz is a fallen angel hellbent on dragging Carl to the underworld with his hellhounds.</p>
         
	       
		      
			<h1>Alice in Wonderland</h1>	
            <p>&#9654; Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland explained. The story of Alice in Wonderland is set in the Victorian era, when hats were a staple of any fashionable Victorian. In the process of making hats, a large amount of Mercury was burned to make the hats. Therefore the hatters were inhaling the gasses from the mercury that eventually causes brain damage and made them go “crazy”. So, that is the reason why the Hatter in Alice in Wonderland is actually mad. (some history lessons for you)</p>
  
	
		         
			<h1>Peter Pan</h1>	
            <p>&#9654; Captain Hook was already the big bad of Peter Pan, but is the pillaging pirate also a major villain of The Little Mermaid as well? With The Little Mermaid coming out in 1989, it was some 19 years before there were any answers to where Ariel’s mother was.The Little Mermaid: Ariel’s Beginning gave us some classic Disney heartache when it revealed Queen Athena had been killed by pirates. Remembering Peter Pan, there was a red-headed mermaid that looked a lot like Ariel cavorting in a lagoon. The mermaids were scared of Hook and he definitely has the right gear on his hand to gut the helpless Athena.</p>
          
		
		        
			<h1>Peter Pan</h1>	
            <p>&#9654; If you’ve ever wondered why the Lost Boys don’t grow up, maybe it’s because they’re already dead and Neverland is some form of afterlife? Peter Pan isn’t the ultimate villain in this – we’d guess it’s Hook as some sort of devil – but the young redhead could be an angel of death. Author JM Barrie’s brother died at the age of 13, leading some to think this is where Barrie's idea of never growing up comes from. The theory also ties with the famous line, "To die would be an awfully big adventure”. Suddenly it isn’t all and parties and pixie dust.</p>
